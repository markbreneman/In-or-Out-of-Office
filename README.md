In or Out of Office
===============

In or Out of Office is a visualizer of what devices(based on Mac Addresses) are on a local area network.

The visualization uses Automator on a Mac to run a script using Fing to generate a CSV file at a timed interval. This generated CSV is then compared to list of known Employee MAC Addresses in order to see if they are on the network or in other words in or out of the office.  

This is a work in progress.
